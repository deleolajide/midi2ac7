# midi2ac7
Utility to create a Casio AC7 style/rhythm file from MIDI files of each music section.

It uses [ac7maker](https://github.com/michgz/ac7maker) to create the casio ac7 file.

I use it create Casio AC7 style files for my portable CT-S500 keyboard from my Ketron SD90 arranger. See the havent_found folder for an example.
